## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The project focuses on **designing, implementing, and configuring a complex enterprise network** that reflects real-world scenarios. The network ensures **functionality, security, and manageability** across different services.

Main network features include:

- Subnetting using VLSM  
- Layer 2/3 configurations  
- Dynamic routing protocols  
- Network services: DHCP, NAT, DNS, Web & Mail  
- IPsec VPN between remote sites  
- Wireless router setup  
- Full testing and documentation

## âœ… Project Objectives

- **VLSM Design:** Implement a subnetting scheme using `10.0.0.0/8`
- **Network Setup:** Interface configuration and IP addressing
- **Layer 2 Config:** VLANs, trunking, inter-VLAN routing, EtherChannel
- **Routing Protocols:** Configure OSPFv2, EIGRP, and route redistribution
- **DHCP:** Centralized and remote DHCP servers
- **NAT:** Dynamic (PAT) and Static NAT implementation
- **Network Management:** NTP, Syslog, DNS, Web & Mail servers
- **VPN:** Secure site-to-site IPsec VPN setup
- **Wireless:** Configure wireless home router with WPA2 security
- **Testing:** Verify using ping, traceroute, routing tables
- **Documentation:** Final report with diagrams, screenshots, and configs
